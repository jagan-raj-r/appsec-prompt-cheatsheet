## üîß How to Use

1. **Choose a Prompt**: Select from general code review or OWASP Top 10 specific prompts
2. **Copy the Prompt**: Each `.md` file contains a complete, ready-to-use prompt
3. **Add Your Code**: Paste your code snippet in the designated section at the bottom
4. **Run Analysis**: Send the complete prompt + code to your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
5. **Review Results**: Get structured vulnerability analysis with fixes and recommendations
6. **Apply Fixes**: Implement the suggested security improvements
