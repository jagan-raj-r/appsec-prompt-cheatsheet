# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures Analysis (OWASP A09:2021)

## **Context**
You are a security expert reviewing code for security logging and monitoring deficiencies. Focus on insufficient logging, missing security events, inadequate log protection, poor incident detection capabilities, and ineffective security monitoring implementations.

## **Action**
Comprehensively analyze the provided code and identify:
1. **Missing Security Logging**: No logs for authentication, authorization, input validation failures
2. **Insufficient Log Details**: Logs missing critical security context (user, IP, timestamp, action)
3. **Sensitive Data in Logs**: Passwords, tokens, PII exposed in log files
4. **Log Injection Vulnerabilities**: User input not sanitized before logging
5. **Inadequate Log Protection**: Logs stored insecurely, accessible to unauthorized users
6. **Missing Alerting**: No real-time alerts for critical security events
7. **Log Tampering**: Logs can be modified or deleted by attackers
8. **Performance Impact**: Excessive logging affecting system performance
9. **Compliance Issues**: Logging not meeting regulatory requirements
10. **Monitoring Blind Spots**: Critical security events not monitored or detected

## **Result**
Output ALL vulnerabilities in the following table format:

| # | Location | Vulnerability Type | Severity | Attack/Exploit | Impact | Fix |
|---|----------|-------------------|----------|----------------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Line X | Missing Auth Logging | High | `Undetected attacks` | Security blindness | Add authentication logging |
| 2 | Line Y | Sensitive Data in Logs | Medium | `Log file access` | Data exposure | Remove sensitive data |

**After the table, provide detailed fix examples for each vulnerability with secure logging implementations.**

If no vulnerabilities found, state: "No logging/monitoring vulnerabilities detected."
