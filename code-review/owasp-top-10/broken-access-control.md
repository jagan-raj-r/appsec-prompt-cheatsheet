# Broken Access Control Analysis (OWASP A01:2021)

## **Context**
You are a security expert reviewing code for ALL types of access control vulnerabilities. Analyze authorization checks, privilege escalation, insecure direct object references (IDOR), missing function-level access control, and other access control bypasses.

## **Action**
Comprehensively analyze the provided code and identify:
1. **Insecure Direct Object References**: User can access others' resources by changing IDs
2. **Missing Authorization**: No access control checks on sensitive functions
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Users can gain higher privileges than intended
4. **Horizontal Access Control**: Users can access other users' data at same privilege level
5. **Vertical Access Control**: Users can access admin/higher privilege functionality
6. **Function-Level Access Control**: Missing checks on administrative functions
7. **Resource-Level Access Control**: Inadequate checks on specific resources/files
8. **Role-Based Access Control Issues**: Improper role validation and assignment
9. **URL/Path-Based Bypasses**: Direct URL access without authorization
10. **API Access Control**: Missing authorization on API endpoints

## **Result**
Output ALL vulnerabilities in the following table format:

| # | Location | Vulnerability Type | Severity | Attack/Exploit | Impact | Fix |
|---|----------|-------------------|----------|----------------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Line X | IDOR | High | `Change user ID in request` | Access other user's data | Add ownership validation |
| 2 | Line Y | Missing Authorization | Critical | `Direct function call` | Admin privilege escalation | Implement access checks |

**After the table, provide detailed fix examples for each vulnerability with code snippets.**

If no vulnerabilities found, state: "No access control vulnerabilities detected."
