# Vulnerable and Outdated Components Analysis (OWASP A06:2021)

## **Context**
You are a security expert reviewing code for vulnerable dependencies, outdated components, and supply chain security issues. Analyze third-party libraries, frameworks, operating system components, and development tools for known security vulnerabilities and update practices.

## **Action**
Comprehensively analyze the provided code and dependencies to identify:
1. **Outdated Dependencies**: Libraries, frameworks with known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
2. **Unmaintained Components**: Dependencies that are no longer actively maintained
3. **Unnecessary Dependencies**: Unused or excessive third-party components
4. **Vulnerable Versions**: Components with publicly disclosed security flaws
5. **Missing Security Updates**: Components that have available security patches
6. **Transitive Dependencies**: Vulnerable indirect dependencies
7. **Development Dependencies**: Vulnerable dev/build tools that could affect production
8. **Container Base Images**: Outdated or vulnerable base images
9. **Runtime Components**: Vulnerable web servers, databases, runtime environments
10. **License Compliance**: Components with incompatible or risky licenses

## **Result**
Output ALL vulnerabilities in the following table format:

| # | Component | Vulnerability Type | Severity | CVE/Advisory | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Library X v1.2.3 | Known CVE | Critical | CVE-2023-1234 | Remote code execution | Update to v1.2.4+ |
| 2 | Framework Y | Outdated Version | High | Multiple CVEs | Various security issues | Upgrade to latest version |

**After the table, provide detailed remediation steps and dependency management recommendations.**

If no vulnerabilities found, state: "No vulnerable component issues detected."
