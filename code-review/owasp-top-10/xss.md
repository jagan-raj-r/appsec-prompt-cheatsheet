# Client-Side Security Analysis (OWASP A03:2021)

## **Context**
You are a security expert reviewing client-side code for ALL injection and security vulnerabilities including XSS, CSRF, insecure DOM manipulation, client-side injection, and other web application security flaws.

## **Action**
Comprehensively analyze the code for ALL client-side security issues:
1. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based XSS in all contexts
2. **DOM Manipulation**: Dangerous functions (innerHTML, document.write, eval)
3. **CSRF Protection**: Missing tokens, improper validation  
4. **Client-Side Injection**: JavaScript injection, JSON injection, CSS injection
5. **Insecure Data Storage**: Sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage
6. **URL/Redirect Vulnerabilities**: Open redirects, JavaScript URL schemes
7. **Content Security Policy**: Missing/weak CSP headers
8. **PostMessage Security**: Insecure cross-origin communication
9. **Third-Party Library Issues**: Vulnerable dependencies, prototype pollution
10. **Input Validation**: Client-side bypass, insufficient validation

## **Result**
Output ALL vulnerabilities in the following table format:

| # | Location | Vulnerability Type | Severity | Payload/Exploit | Impact | Fix |
|---|----------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Line X | DOM-based XSS | High | `<script>alert(1)</script>` | What attacker achieves | Secure solution |
| 2 | Line Y | Missing CSRF | High | `attack method` | What attacker achieves | Secure solution |

**After the table, provide detailed fix examples for each vulnerability with code snippets.**

If no vulnerabilities found, state: "No client-side vulnerabilities detected."
